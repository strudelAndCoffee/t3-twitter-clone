# Twitter Clone - NextJS, Prisma, tRPC, TypeScript, Vercel practice app

This repository is only an exercise in working with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). The deployed application uses a local instance of a MySQL database and will not run properly when visited.

All code in this repository was originally authored by [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified), and coded by Stevie Trudell following the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqVm5_G1ZEE) on YouTube. You can find the tutorial repo [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/twitter-clone).

## Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
